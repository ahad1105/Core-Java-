interface uses the keyword "implements" 
interface can only work with abstract methods , no need to write abstract keyword in an interface class
interface can be used to achieve multiple inheritance which is not possible in a class 
interface is use to achieve abstraction(data hiding and showing only necessary data) 
we cannot create an object of interface we can only create a reference of it. 

interface Writer
{
	void write();
}
class Pen implements Writer
{
	public void write()
	{
		System.out.println("Im a Pen");
	}
}
class Pencil implements Writer
{
	public void write()
	{
		System.out.println("Im a Pencil");
	}
}
class Kit
{
	public void doSomething(Writer p)
	{
		p.write();
	}
}
public class InterfaceDemo 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Kit k = new Kit();
		Writer p = new Pen();
		
		Writer pc = new Pencil();
		
		k.doSomething(pc);
	}
}
